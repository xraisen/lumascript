## Systematic Approach
1. File Scan
   ```
   ├── Check existing files
   ├── Identify conflicts
   ├── Resolve dependencies
   └── Verify integrity
   ```

2. Implementation
   ```
   ├── Follow ZERO principles
   ├── Apply 7 habits
   ├── Document changes
   └── Version control
   ```

3. Verification
   ```
   ├── Run tests
   ├── Check performance
   ├── Validate memory usage
   └── Verify integration
   ```

4. Debug Protocol
   ```
   ├── Identify issue
   ├── Maximum 10 attempts
   ├── Document solutions
   └── Learn from failures
   ```
